### Intro
Hello, my name is $NAME.

I'm currently a customer, and wanted to check on a few things.
I'm considering buying this pump, and wanted to check on a few things.

## Questions
I was looking through the user manual, but it doesn't contain some of
information I need to use the device effectively.  Can we receive a copy of the documentation missing from published manuals, which would include:
  * method of communicating data from device
  * method to test existing features, bolus, basal, verifying that recorded
    settings are same as input
