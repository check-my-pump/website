We'd like the serial protocol to the Carelink USB stick, aka `MMT-7305NA`. 
Decocare is an open source driver for a commercially available device, the
MMT-7305NA. The user’s guide:

indicates intended use is:

> Indications for use The Medtronic CareLink™ USB is indicated for use by
> patients at home and clinicians in a medical office setting to facilitate
> communication between Medtronic diabetes therapy management devices that use
> Paradigm-compatible RF telemetry (MWT1)
* and a personal computer that uses data management application software.

### Intro
Hello, my name is $NAME.

I'm currently a customer, and wanted to check on a few things.
I'm considering buying this pump, and wanted to check on a few things.


## Questions
The need and desire to connect medical devices to each other as well as other
products, technologies, and systems is growing in the healthcare community.
This interconnectivity of various products or systems that includes $MYPUMP.

The $USERMANUAL user manual for $MYPUMP has been reviewed carefully, but it doesn't contain some of
information I need to use the device.  Can we receive a copy of the
documentation missing from published manuals, which would include:
  * method of communicating data from device
    * often known as the "communication protocol"
  * method to test existing features, bolus, basal, verifying that recorded
    settings are same as input
